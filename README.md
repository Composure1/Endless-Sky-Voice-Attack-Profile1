# Endless-Sky-Voice-Attack-Profile1
This is a Voice Attack Profile for running Endless Sky by voice.

I chose the GPL 3 because I wanted this project of mine to be shareable with other people. My hope is that at some point Endless Sky will get an API and then this 
profile and Voice Attack will really begin to hit it off, but even without an API, my goal is bring interest to Endless Sky through a different way to play it, and 
interest to Voice Attack from the Endless Sky community as a cool and amazing voice/macro program.

While this is definitely a pipe dream, my dream would be to get the attention of HCS and have them do a voice pack for Endless Sky, even if it's not William Shatner who 
accompanies us on our voyages of exploration throughout the Milky Way.

I dare to dream big. I hope my microcosm of ambition draws people to contribute to this, to Endless Sky, or to Voice Attack.
